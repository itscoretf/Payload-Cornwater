# Cornwater
Alternate universe Badwater with competitive play and visual consistency at the forefront. Welcome to Sunny/Alpine Badwater now fondly known as Cornwater.

As a person with Deuteranopia (red-green colour blindness), the original Badwater had terrible visibility for me, and the existing "Pro" orientated versions didn't do much to help. Alpine/Sunny I have always found the best visibility-wise, so I figured that Badwater could use a makeover. Enter Cornwater.

The majority of the map balancing and existing changes are competitively orientated, however, this should be a vastly better community server experience than stock Badwater.

This is my first published map, but I would like to thank the Refresh team, especially harris0n, xobile & JackyLegs for being absolute legends when I needed help figuring out Hammer and being super patient with the common first map mistakes, finding issues on the map and more. I would also like to thank fubar for his help earlier in the process and for his improved alpine/mining rocks, along with his amazing tool BSPReveal!

The intention of this map is to (hopefully) provide a good base of which with the league and player feedback can be used to expand and improve upon Badwater further than what previous "Pro" iterations have. The aim for the gameplay changes already made are to be as minimal as possible and to only improve on what is already regarded as standard between the Badwater versions.
